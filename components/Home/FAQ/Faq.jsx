                        Sometimes—this depends on the dog and the other participants. We ask the
                        whole group first; if even <strong>one</strong> student is uncomfortable,
                        dogs aren’t allowed on that course.

                        <li>No chasing wildlife</li>
                        <li>No getting into food</li>
                        <li>No nuisance barking</li>
                        <li>No nipping people or other dogs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        You’re responsible for your pet’s behavior. If you miss parts of the course
                        or must leave to relocate the dog, that’s on you.

                        Historically, ~80% of dog-allowed courses have gone smoothly. If you think
                        your dog is a good fit, contact us and we’ll check with participants.
